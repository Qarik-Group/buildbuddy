If you've hung out around developers for any extended period --- you've probably heard "my code is compiling" as an excuse from them when they're slacking off and browsing Hacker News.

Slow, flaky builds waste hours of developer time --- leading to slow dev refresh cycles and unhappy, unproductive engineers. This is the problem we're solving at BuildBuddy.

[BuildBuddy](http://buildbuddy.io/) is a managed [Bazel](https://bazel.build/) build system. It brings a Google-style development environment and 10x faster builds to any company.

We're excited to share that we've been accepted into [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/) and have been participating in their Winter 2020 batch. Here's a photo from our first batch dinner where the founders of Airbnb (YC Winter 2009) told us stories about their YC experience:
